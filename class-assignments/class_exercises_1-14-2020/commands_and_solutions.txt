This file contains the commands used during the manipulation of the data-shell file. The explanations are in the file commands_with_explanations_and_solutions.txt. After this, I listed my answers to the exercises posted throughout the tutorial.

Working with the data-shell directory:

Typed command: cd Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/class_exercises_1-14-2020/data-shell

Typed command: pwd

Typed command: ls -F

Typed command: mkdir thesis

Typed command: ls -F

Typed command: ls -F thesis

Typed command: cd thesis

Typed command: nano draft.txt

Typed two lines of text into nano.

Typed commands: ctrl + o, enter, ctrl + x

Typed command: ls

Typed command: touch my_file.txt

Typed command: ls -l

Typed command: cd .. (Same as typing: ~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/class_exercises_1-14-2020/data-shell)

Typed command: mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt

Typed command: ls thesis

Typed command: mv thesis/quotes.txt .

Typed command: ls thesis.

Typed command: ls quotes.txt

Typed command: cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

Typed command: ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

Typed command: ls thesis thesis_backup

Typed command: rm quotes.txt

Typed command: ls quotes.txt

Typed command: rm -r thesis

Typed command: cd data

Typed command: mkdir backup

Typed command: cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/

Exercises:

Creating files a different way:

1. The touch command created a new file (my_file.txt) in the current directory. 
2. The command ls -l listed the sizes of the files (my_file.txt is zero bytes). 
3. The touch command is useful for creating a file without opening it for programs that require an already existing file. 

Moving files to a new folder:

The following commands are run: 
ls -F
 analyzed/ raw/
ls -F analyzed
fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
cd analyzed

However the sucrose and maltose files should be in the raw folder. The command mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw should place them in the raw directory. 

Renaming files:

To rename statstics.txt to statistics.txt run the command: mv statstics.txt statistics.txt

Moving and copying:

The follwing commands are run in a directory (named data) with a file named proteins.dat
mkdir recombine
mv proteins.dat recombine/
cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
ls

The ls command yields the output recombine since that is the only directory in the data directory and the proteins.dat file is in the recombine folder and the protein-saved.dat folder is in the directory that stores the data directory. 

Using rm safely: 

Running the command: rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt yields rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'? Answering Y will delete it. Answering N will not. This is useful for confirmation of which file one is deleting. 

Copy with multiple filenames:

When given several file names the cp command copies the files to the directory at the end of the command. If the command cp is followed by three file names and no directory the output will state the last file is not a directory. 

List filenames matching a pattern:

In the molecules directory, the ls command ls *t??ne.pdb will produce the output: ethane.pdb methane.pdb

More on wildcards:

Commands Sam should type:
cp *dataset* backup/datasets
cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

Organizing directories and files:

Jamie needs to move fructose.dat and sucrose.dat to analyzed directory. The command to do this is: mv *.dat analyzed

Reproduce a folder structure:

To achieve the folder structure commands 1 and 2 will work:

Command 1:
mkdir 2016-05-20
mkdir 2016-05-20/data
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw

Command 2:
mkdir 2016-05-20
cd 2016-05-20
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir raw processed
